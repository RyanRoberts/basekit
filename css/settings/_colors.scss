/// Brand Colours
///
/// The three brand specific colours should come from a style guide
/// or other brand guidelines provided by a designer. I then generate lighter and
/// darker varients but it's not necessary to use them, however you *should* check
/// that they look sensible.

$primary: tomato;
$primary--light: lighten($primary, 15%);
$primary--dark: darken($primary, 20%);

$secondary: dodgerblue;
$secondary--light: lighten($secondary, 15%);
$secondary--dark: darken($secondary, 20%);

$tertiary: lightgrey;
$tertiary--light: lighten($tertiary, 15%);
$tertiary--dark: darken($tertiary, 10%);

$grey-light: lightgrey;
$grey-mid: grey;
$grey-dark: dimgrey;

/// Document Colours
///
/// The following colours are for standard elements commonly found
/// across any site or document.

/// Set the body colour here, if you want to add an image you should configure
/// the $body-media currently in set.media.scss
$body: whitesmoke;

/// Set the primary (body) text colour
$text: $grey-dark;

/// This is optional, you're better off using the color utility classes to set
/// the colour on headings unless there is very little variation in heading
/// colours.
$heading: $text;

/// Alert Colours
///
/// Alert classes can be used anywhere but for now they're tied to
/// form alerts, set the colours here if you want to change them.
$alert-text: white;
$alert-bg: orangered;
/// Set the following to null to prevent any CSS being needlessly compiled.
$alert-bg--neutral: dodgerblue;
$alert-bg--positive: limegreen;
